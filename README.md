# Birthstone Bounce

Birthstone Bounce is the sibling family of Birthstone that adds more luster and playfulness to it. Available in Regular and Medium weights, this version includes caps and ending swashed forms.

All the styles are uniquely compatible to one another, but distinctly different. See how easily the fonts may change according to the needs of the look.

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you particularly want to build fonts manually on your own computer, you will need to install the [`yq` utility](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). On OS X with Homebrew, type `brew install yq`; on Linux, try `snap install yq`; if all else fails, try the instructions on the linked page.

Then:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://yourname.github.io/your-font-repository-name`.
